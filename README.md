Server Side API Challenge #6

â€‹This program will allow users to search for the 5 day weather forecast for a given city. The weather dashboard runs in the browser and features HTML and CSS to retrieve weather data from the OpenWeather One Call API.

When searching for a city, the user is presented with current and future conditions for that city which includes the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed. The 5-day forecast displays the date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind conditions, and humidity for each following day. When clicking on a city in the search history, the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city. So you can plan your trip accordingly.

LocalStorage stores prior search data and is cleared upon clicking the "Clear" button.
